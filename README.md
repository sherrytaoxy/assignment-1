Sherry Tao

I'm a sophomore majoring in environmental studies, I'm looking into 
environmental consulting jobs in the future. I took this class because I 
think it is very important to know a little data analysis especially 
related with environmental data, so this course would be a great fit for 
my need. I like playing frisbee.
