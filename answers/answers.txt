How can you use ls to list files outside of your current directory? (1 pt)

Remove can't be reversed, so if I accidentally run it, I will lose things I don't want to lose. For example, if I rm answers.txt, I would probably have to restart from the beginning, which is not great.

$ mkdir results

$ nano my_script.sh

$ chmod 775 my_script.sh

$ cd data
$ for file in data

(I have to change my_script.sh a little bit, because in your description, you asked for the second column of each tsv, but the code can only give me the first column, so I changed the 1 in the last row to 2, I think that is how I got the right results.)

14.
$ cd data        (I think I am in here already from the last question, but just to show where I'm at)
$ unzip '*.zip'
$ mv annual_aqi_by_county*.csv unzipped-files

15.
$ rm (-i) *.zip

16.
$ mv annual_aqi_by_county_200?.csv ~/GitHub/assignment-1/answers/results
